                        <h1>About Me</h1>
                        <p>Prior to pursuing this path into cybersecurity, I worked in IT services and at a Fintech company, where I ensured the smooth-running of 
                            the day-to-day operations and provided customer support. The nature of my work was dealing with sensitive information and looking for areas 
                            to improve the operational efficiency. Realizing that my limited tech skills at that time prevented me from making our processes more efficient 
                            added to my desire to increase my technical abilities. I started to dabble in code, but I was always wondering about the security aspect—I 
                            wondered how do you build something and ensure that it is secure?  I became increasingly curious to understand more about technology from the 
                            grounds up, wanting to understand the networking and security concepts and how it all fit together.  </p>
                        <p>Transitioning to Cybersecurity has been an empowering journey, and I am excited to use my new-found knowledge to help mitigate risks and prevent 
                            business disruptions. I love that this career path allows me to take on intellectual challenges and to remain curious and to continue to expand 
                            my knowledge. I enjoy both reactive and proactive work and look forward to contributing to a company’s cyber success.</p>
